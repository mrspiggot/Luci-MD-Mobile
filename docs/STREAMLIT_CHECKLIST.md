# Guide to Developing and Deploying a Streamlit Application

This guide provides a step-by-step process for developing, deploying, and maintaining a Streamlit application. Follow these instructions to ensure a smooth development workflow and deployment process.

## Development

1. **Write the Python code** and test it on your machine.
2. **Develop your Streamlit application locally.**
   - Regularly run your app using `streamlit run your_app.py` to test functionality.
3. **Use virtual environments** to manage dependencies specific to your app.

## Setting Up Version Control

1. **Create a GitHub repository.**
2. Initialize a local Git repository in your project folder with `git init`.
3. Create a new repository on GitHub.
4. Link your local repository to GitHub with `git remote add origin your-repository-url`.
5. Ensure your `.gitignore` file is set up to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `__pycache__`, virtual environment folders, etc.).
6. Alternatively, simply clone this repository as a starting point.

## Syncing Code and Dependencies

1. Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to create a `requirements.txt` file that lists all your app’s dependencies.
2. Add your code and `requirements.txt` to the repository using `git add .`
3. Commit your changes with a meaningful message using `git commit -m "your commit message"`.
4. Push your code to GitHub with `git push origin main` (assuming your main branch is called 'main').

## Deploying the App

1. Navigate to the Streamlit sharing platform and log in to your Streamlit account.
2. Click on "New app" or "Deploy" to start the deployment process.
3. Select your GitHub repository and branch where your app code exists.
4. Provide any necessary secrets or environment variables.
   - Click on the Streamlit logo to access your account settings if necessary.
   - Go to the 'Secrets' section if your app requires any sensitive information like API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
   - Add your secrets in the provided format. Streamlit encrypts this information and exposes it to your app as environment variables.
5. **Configure advanced settings if required.**
   - Adjust resources like memory and CPU if your app has specific requirements.
   - Set up advanced routing and custom domains if needed.
6. **Launch your app** by clicking "Deploy". Streamlit will provide you with a URL where you can access your app.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Use the Streamlit dashboard to monitor your app’s health, view logs, and see visitor statistics.
2. For issues, refer to the logs for debugging information.
3. Commit and push updates to your GitHub repository for further development. Streamlit sharing will automatically redeploy your app with the updates.

## Sharing Your App

- Use the provided Streamlit URL to share your app with users.
- Add a `README.md` in your GitHub repository with information about your app, how to use it, and its features.
